At CareerFoundry, I serve as a mentor for both the Frontend Development for Designers and Full-Stack Web Developer courses. I combine my love for teaching and mentorship and provide 1-on-1 support to students through lessons and projects that culminate into building a fully functional portfolio and e-commerce shop. Through regular video calls and detailed assignment reviews, I provide guidance, knowledge-sharing and career coaching to support students on their journey towards becoming future web developers and designers.
