Urban Outfitters is a lifestyle retailer dedicated to inspiring customers through a unique combination of product, creativity, and cultural understanding.  As a lead developer, I worked on every facet of their online store, from homepage updates, to product pages, and checkout while also managing and mentoring other developers on the team.

## Technologies
* Java/JSP
* AngularJS
* Mocha
* HTML
* Sass

## Without Walls

By far the largest project I worked on during my time at Urban Outfitters was the development and launch of (now defunct) athleisure brand,  Without Walls. This gave the team the ability to build an entire e-commerce website from scratch with all the ideal standards and best practices in place. We implemented responsive and mobile-first design from the get-go as well as utilized modern frameworks like AngularJS and testing with Mocha to build out features.
