Hi there! Iâ€™m currently a Software Engineer at [Big Cartel](http://www.bigcartel.com/), working hard to help artists and musicians make a living doing what they love.  Previously, I was a developer at Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, and REI.

I am passionate about UX and am interested in the intersection between design and development and how I, as an engineer, can be a meaningful contributor to the UX process.  I have a strong desire to help researchers and designers test drive new concepts, through the use of wireframes, prototypes, and usability testing.  I also am an advocate for design systems and architectures to help bridge the gap between design and development.

I care deeply about building an inclusive tech community and have volunteered with organizations like [Philly Tech Sistas](https://www.phillytechsistas.org/) and [Coded by Kids](https://www.codedbykids.com/).  Additionally, I am a mentor at [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/home), where I help students grow the skills they need to become future web developers and designers.

In a past life, I played in a few punk bands, acted in a [short film](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm10119018/), and currently am working on a zine of my [photography](https://www.instagram.com/cellamonet/).

I live, work, and play in sunny Philadelphia with my pup, Kuma.
