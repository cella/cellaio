Hi there! Iâ€™m currently a Software Engineer at [Big Cartel](http://www.bigcartel.com/), working hard to help artists and makers make a living doing what they love.  Previously, I was a developer at Urban Outfitters, Anthropologie, and REI.  I'm a Master of Human-Computer Interaction (MHCID) candidate at UC Irvine and hold a B.S. in Computer Science from Shippensburg University.

I am passionate about UX and am interested in the intersection between design and development and how I, as an engineer, can be a meaningful contributor to the UX process.  I have a strong desire to help researchers and designers test drive new concepts, through the use of wireframes, prototypes, and usability testing.  I also am an advocate for design systems and architectures to help bridge the gap between design and development.

I care deeply about building an inclusive tech community and have volunteered with organizations like [Philly Tech Sistas](https://www.phillytechsistas.org/) and [Coded by Kids](https://www.codedbykids.com/).  Additionally, I served as a mentor at [CareerFoundry](https://careerfoundry.com/en/home), where I helped students grow the skills they need to become future web developers and designers.

In a past life, I played in a few punk bands, acted in a short film, and currently am working on a zine of my [photography](https://www.instagram.com/cellamonet/).

I live, work, and play in Los Angeles with my pup, Kuma.
